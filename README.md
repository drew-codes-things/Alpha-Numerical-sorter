# Alpha-Numerical Sorter  
A command-line script I made in Python to sort the contents of `.txt`, `.csv`, `.log`, `.md`, or `.json` files alphabetically or numerically, with options for order direction and line filtering.

## How to use
1. Run `cd <dir>` to move into the script's directory (`Set-Location` if using PowerShell)
2. Make sure you have Python 3+ installed. You can check by running `python --version`
3. Place any `.txt`, `.csv`, `.log`, `.md`, or `.json` files you want to sort in the same directory
4. Run the script using `python main.py` 

## Features
- Supports `.txt`, `.csv`, `.log`, `.md`, `.json` files
- Interactive and beginner-friendly CLI
- Step-by-step sorting with the option to go back by pressing `b`
- Alphabetical sort with capitalized first letters
- Numerical sort using the first digit of each line
- Optional skipping of empty lines
- Output saved in a separate file to preserve the original

## Issues
